# GlobalHealth-Data-Analysis
- The project aimed to conduct an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on life expectancy data, exploring relationships between socio-economic indicators, health factors, and life expectancy across different countries.
-  Predictive models were built using regression algorithms to forecast life expectancy, with comprehensive evaluation of model performance using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).
-  Insights gained from the project provide valuable understanding of determinants of life expectancy, aiding policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers in formulating effective strategies to improve public health outcomes and addressing global disparities in healthcare access and education.
